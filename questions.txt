10. There are a number of phrases, depending on the word, but they all get stuck in a loop of some form. The most common one I see is some version of "is a little girl in the world"

14. Mainly due to common word patterns and the "greedy" way in which I have implemented the word finding so far, a lot of word patterns follow each other. For example, the "you ready love"
pattern - "ready" most commonly follows "you" and "love" most commonly follows "ready". That is fine, but "you" most commonly follows "love", so the program gets trapped in a loop of sorts
since the most common second word ends up producing the same pattern. Additionally, these "looper words" are common words, so almost every word typed into the program is effected by this
issue.

15. I tried book, computer, water, fly, flower, and amore. The only one that I found that terminated before 20 words was amore, but that's because it's not in English and therefore had less
words to work with in the set - the title found was "amore mio babbino caro gianni schicchi". Every other word I tried got caught in a loop.

16. I added a structure that penalizes words for being used before.

21. I like the capabilities Ruby has - it feels like a mix of Python and Java. The shorthands are very nice in particular - I like how simple loops are to setup and the variability of
the built-in functionality, such as {number}.times. The overall syntax feels very friendly and there is plenty of documentation.  String manipulation felt very easy with regular
expressions and the built-in string manipulation functions.

22. I don't like the variety of print commands so much - it seems like they each do their own thing. For example, sometimes "p" will put quotes around things, even though "puts" does
not always do this and "p" is shorthand for "puts." I've found that I just prefer to use "print" since all formatting is specified by the coder. However, I concede that this and other
small things I disliked about Ruby during this lab (I don't remember anything else now) may just be due to some of my unfamiliarities with parts of the language. All languages have 
disadvantages, of course, but Ruby felt like a breath of fresh air compared to Java. One small thing that bothered me was the use of "elsif" instead of "elif" or "else if" - I just
don't like the sound of "elsif."

23. Yes - I very much enjoyed how each step was guided, but enough was concealed that it was a challenge. The self-checks were very helpful as well. 

24. Probably around 15 hours or so - I definitely felt like I put more time in than I maybe should have, but I like to understand everything that is going on. 

25. Yes, but I'm not completely sure for what. I think that it would be extremely useful for any type of string manipulation projects, or potentially machine learning related
projects. Having taken machine learning in semesters previous, I think it would be easier to implement algorithms in Ruby than in Java.
